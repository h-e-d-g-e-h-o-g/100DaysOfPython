Instead of rewriting the same structure for each webpage of our website.
We can use templates to ease our work.
With the help of Jinja, we can use html file as template.
By using the template, we can give the structure to a webpage without writing code for it.
We just need to include the template into the current file for the webpage having the same structure.
In order to it, we can take the help of syntax:-
{% include "template_name" %}
The template_name has required code for the structure.
Where we put the syntax, the code in that template will be placed at that place.
