# Here, we are going to use canvas widget. Canvas widget works like real life canvas.
# Where, we can put one object over another. Like drawing one object over another.
# Here, we are going to put image onto our program, then we are going to put text over that image.
# Now, how to create or put image on the canvas. For that, we need to use "create_image".
# create_image() needs the x and y positions of the image in order to place the image.
# Then, it takes the PhotoImage object as argument in order to specify which image needs to be drawn on the canvas.
# The PhotoImage() class makes easy to read through the file in order to hold that image at that file location.
# Here, we can't use another loop in order to make the window to wait. As, we have already mainloop().
# So, we would not reach to the mainloop() after running the another loop.
# Here, we are using after(), in order to make the window to wait for a second, and then, call the function passed
# in the method and then pass the arguments which are going to be passed in the function need to call up.
